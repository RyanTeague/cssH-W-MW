    <!--CSS Height, Width and Max-width
    
        The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and
        width of an element

        The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an 
        element.

    <!--CSS Setting height and width
    
        The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of 
        an element.

        The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or
        margins. It set the height/width of athe area inside the padding, border, and
        margin of the element
    -->

    <!--CSS hkeight and width Values
    
        The height and width properties may have the following values:

            . auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
            . length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
            . % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containg block
            . initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
            . inherit - The height/width will be inherited form its parent value
    -->

    <!--CSS height and width Examples
    
        Set the height and width of a <div> element:
    -->

    <h2>Set the height and width of an element</h2>

    <div>This div element has a height of 200px and a width of 50%.</div>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Set the height and width of an element</h2>

    <div>This div element has a height of 100px and a width of 500px.</div>


    <!--Note: Rememeber that the height and width properties do not include
    padding, borders, or margins! They set the heigth/width of the area inside
    the padding, border, and margin of the element!-->

    <!--Setting max-width
    
        The max-width property isused to set the maximum width of an element.

        The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in
        percent (%) of the containg block, or set to none (this is default. Means
        that there is no maximum width).

        The problem with the <div> above occures when the browser window is 
        smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser thent adds a 
        horizontal scrollbar to the page.

        Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's
        handing of small windows.

        Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the
        difference between the two divs!

        Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width
        property on the same element, and the value of the width property
        is larger than the max-width property; the max-width prperty will be
        used (and the width property will be ignored).
    -->

    <h2>Set the max-width of an element</h2>

<div>This div element has a height of 100px and a max-width of 500px.</div>

<p>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>
